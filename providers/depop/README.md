# Depop connector

Drives Depop's web API using your logged-in browser session.

```bash
mastro login depop
mastro depop search "holiday knit jumper men" --sizes M
mastro depop search "carhartt jacket" --conditions used_good --colours green --sortBy priceAscending
mastro depop search "vintage tee" --brandIds nike --priceMax 50 --isDiscounted --json
mastro depop me
```

The connector is described by [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml) (a valid OpenAPI 3.1
document) plus [`auth.manifest.json`](auth.manifest.json) for the browser capture.

## How auth works

Depop's web app stores auth in two cookies on `depop.com`:

| Cookie         | Use                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `access_token` | Bearer token for the web API         |
| `user_id`      | Your numeric account id (`x-user-id`)|

`access_token` is **HttpOnly**, so page JavaScript can't read it — the mastro
extension reads it via `chrome.cookies`. `mastro login depop` opens Depop, waits
until both cookies exist, and stores them (token redacted in logs).

Each request also sends client-generated `depop-device-id` / `depop-session-id`
/ `depop-search-id` UUIDs — the spec mints these per request via `${uuid}`.

## How replay works

The web API sits behind a Cloudflare **managed challenge** (the "Just a moment"
JS interstitial). TLS impersonation alone can't solve it — even a perfect Chrome
handshake with the captured cookies gets a `403`. So Depop sets
`x-mastro-replay.via_browser: true`, and mastro runs the request **inside your
logged-in browser tab** (which already cleared the challenge) via the extension.
See [`docs/BROWSER-PROXY.md`](../../docs/BROWSER-PROXY.md).

**Requirement:** the mastro extension must be installed/enabled and you must have
a logged-in **depop.com tab open** (mastro will open one if needed). No
`curl-impersonate` needed.

```
mastro depop search ...
  → mastro proxy server (127.0.0.1:7878)
  → extension runs fetch() in your depop.com tab (past Cloudflare)
  → JSON back to the CLI
```

## Commands

| Command  | Endpoint / flow                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `search` | `GET https://www.depop.com/presentation/api/v1/search/products/` |
| `me`     | `GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}/` — ⚠️ see host note (currently 404s) |
| `list`   | multi-step workflow: upload photos → poll → create listing |
| `update` | `PATCH https://webapi.depop.com/presentation/api/v1/listing/products/{id}/` — edit a listing, photos excluded |

> **Host split (important — it's the #1 source of 404s).** Depop serves its API
> from **two** hosts. `www.depop.com` answers the `/presentation/*` search path.
> Everything under `/api/*` and `/internal/*` — picture upload, validate,
> batch-poll, `users/{id}` — plus the listing-create POST lives on
> **`webapi.depop.com`**. Hitting an `/api/*` path on `www` returns a Next.js
> **404 HTML page** (`__next_error__`), not JSON — that HTML 404 is the signature
> of "right path, wrong host." Workflow steps that need the webapi host set an
> explicit `request.url`.
>
> ⚠️ **Known gap:** the `me` command is a plain (non-workflow) operation, so it
> can't set a per-step URL and still hits `www` → 404. It needs an operation-level
> host override (the workflow `list` steps already work around this with explicit
> `request.url`s).

### Listing an item

```bash
mastro depop list \
  --photo front.jpg --photo back.jpg \
  --brand polo-ralph-lauren \
  --department menswear --type tshirts --size M \
  --condition used_good --colour navy \
  --price 25 \
  --description "Vintage Polo tee ... #ralphlauren #vintage" \
  --address-id 42475963 --address "San Francisco, United States" \
  --lat 37.779026 --lng -122.419906 \
  [--dry-run]
```

- **Photos must be square JPEGs** (the `depop-list-item` skill handles
  HEIC→JPEG + cropping; mastro uploads them as-is).
- `variant_set`, `gender`, and the size **`variant`** are **derived** from
  `--department`/`--type`/`--size` via bundled reference data
  (`reference/categories.json`, `reference/department_gender.json`,
  `reference/size_variants.json`) — you don't pass internal ids. The size maps
  through two keyed lookups: `(department/type)→size_set`, then
  `(size_set/size)→variant` member id, which becomes the `variants` map on the
  listing so the size attaches correctly.
- **`--dry-run` builds and prints every request body without uploading or
  posting** — always dry-run first. See [`docs/WORKFLOWS.md`](../../docs/WORKFLOWS.md).

### Updating a listing

Edits everything except photos. Only the flags you pass are sent, so any field
you leave out keeps its current value.

```bash
mastro depop update 123456789 --price 20 --dry-run
mastro depop update 123456789 --description "Vintage Polo tee #ralphlauren #vintage"
mastro depop update 123456789 --department menswear --type tshirts --size L
mastro depop update 123456789 --parcel-size large --address-id 42475963
```

The listing id is the numeric product id (positional, or `--id`). Everything the
create body carries except photos is editable: `--price`, `--currency`,
`--description`, `--brand`, `--condition`, `--colour`, `--department`, `--type`,
`--size`, `--quantity`, `--age`, `--style`, `--source`, `--address`, `--lat`,
`--lng`, `--address-id`, `--parcel-size`.

- **Two fields go out as a whole block or not at all.** Size is the `variants`
  map, so it needs `--department --type --size` together (the same derivation
  `list` uses); shipping needs `--parcel-size`, and `--address-id` on its own is
  ignored. Sending half a group would overwrite what is on the listing today.
- **Never sent:** `picture_ids` (photos are a separate piece of work),
  `boost`, and the create-time `listing_lifecycle_id` / `persistent_id`.
- Depop's payload has no title field. The listing text is `description`.
- An empty value counts as "not passed", so `--description ""` does not clear
  the text.

> ⚠️ **The wire shape is not verified yet.** `list` was recovered from a real
> capture; this was not. The method, path, and field names are inferred from the
> create payload, which is ground truth for what a listing holds but not for how
> an edit is submitted. A HAR of an actual edit on depop.com has to settle three
> things: whether it is `PATCH .../listing/products/{id}/` or a `PUT` or a
> separate path; whether `{id}` is the numeric product id or the slug; and
> whether Depop merges the fields you send or replaces the whole product. If it
> replaces, this command needs a read step first (GET the listing, merge, send it
> all back including `picture_ids`) or an edit will drop what it omits.
> **Dry-run first and check the body.**

### Search filters

Every filter from the website's filter bar is a flag, generated from the spec:

| Flag             | Wire param     | Notes |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| `--what`         | `what`         | required search text |
| `--categories`   | `categories`   | repeatable; id or label (resolved via `categoryFilters`) |
| `--brandIds`     | `brandIds`     | repeatable; id or brand name (resolved via `brandsById`) |
| `--sizes`        | `sizes`        | repeatable; composite id or label e.g. `M` (resolved via `sizeFilters`) |
| `--colours`      | `colours`      | repeatable; enum (black, grey, white, …) |
| `--conditions`   | `conditions`   | repeatable; enum (brand_new, used_good, …) |
| `--priceMin/Max` | `priceMin/Max` | numeric |
| `--isDiscounted` | `isDiscounted` | boolean; "on sale" |
| `--sortBy`       | `sortBy`       | relevance \| priceAscending \| priceDescending \| newlyListed |
| `--limit`        | `limit`        | results per page (default 24) |
| `--after`        | `after`        | pagination cursor (`page_info.last` of the previous page) |

The `sizes` / `brandIds` / `categories` value lists are **fetched from Depop's
own filter-metadata endpoints** (`sizeFilters`, `brandsById`, `categoryFilters`,
declared `x-mastro-hidden` in the spec) and cached under
`~/.mastro/cache/depop/`, so `--sizes M` resolves to the wire id `54.4`
automatically.

## Status & drift

`status: reverse_engineered` — observed from browser traffic, can change without
notice. If `search` starts returning Cloudflare HTML or a shape without an
`objects` array:

1. `mastro login depop` (most failures are an expired session → `401`/`419`).
2. Capture a fresh HAR from depop.com's Network tab and diff the
   `search/products` request against `openapi.yaml`.

> Reverse-engineered from a real HAR (`~/Downloads/www.depop.com.har`) plus the
> earlier `depop-cli`. The HAR only exercised the `sizes` filter; the other
> param names (`brandIds`, `colours`, `conditions`, `priceMin/Max`,
> `isDiscounted`, `sortBy`) were recovered from the response payloads. The
> `sortBy` enum values should be re-verified on the next capture.

> The write flow (image upload + listing creation), ported from the original
> `depop-cli`, **is** implemented as the `list` workflow (verified live). Its
> createListing body must match Depop's exactly or the endpoint returns an opaque
> `400` ("Request failed with status code 400") — the ground-truth shape is
> `depop-cli`'s `build_listing_body` + the appended `picture_ids`. Watch these on
> drift: the `webapi.depop.com` host for the write endpoints, integer
> `picture_ids` (extracted from the slot S3 URL), numeric `geo_position_*` /
> `ship_from_address_id` / `variant_set`, `quantity: null` when `variants` is set,
> and `is_kids`.

> The `update` flow is derived from that same create body but has **not** been
> confirmed against a captured edit (see the warning above). Two known gaps for
> the next capture: `is_kids` is never sent, so moving a listing into or out of
> kidswear may not stick, and `quantity` is sent as passed rather than as
> create's `null`-when-sized convention.
