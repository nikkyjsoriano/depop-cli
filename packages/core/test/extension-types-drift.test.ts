/**
 * Drift guard for the extension's hand-maintained type mirror.
 *
 * `extension/types.d.ts` re-declares the manifest shape as ambient types so the
 * plain-JS extension can be checkJs-verified without importing @depop/core.
 * Nothing fails at build time when the canonical contract changes and the mirror
 * doesn't — they just silently diverge until a capture breaks at runtime.
 *
 * The JSON schema (browser-auth-manifest.schema.json) is the runtime authority:
 * every manifest is validated against it. This test asserts that every field
 * name the schema knows about also appears in the extension's mirror, so adding
 * a capture field to the schema without teaching the extension to read it fails
 * here instead of in production. It's a name-level check, not a full structural
 * one — cheap, and it catches the realistic drift (a renamed/added field).
