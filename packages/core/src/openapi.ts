/**
 * The OpenAPI 3.1 subset mastro consumes, plus the `x-mastro-*` extensions.
 *
 * A connector's API is described as a *valid* OpenAPI 3.1 document. We model
 * only the parts we actually read (paths → operations → parameters → schemas,
 * security schemes) rather than the entire spec — but a full OpenAPI doc is
 * still accepted, we just ignore what we don't use.
 *
 * Three things OpenAPI genuinely cannot express live in spec-legal `x-`
 * extensions (validators MUST ignore unknown `x-` keys, so the document stays a
 * conformant OpenAPI 3.1 doc):
 *
 *   x-mastro-auth     replay choreography: which captured fields become which
 *                     headers/cookies, and per-request generated values (uuid).
 *   x-mastro-resolve  a parameter whose valid values come from ANOTHER
 *                     operation's response (dynamic taxonomies: sizes, brands).
 *   x-mastro-command  the CLI subcommand name for an operation (defaults to
 *                     operationId).
 *   x-mastro-result   dotted path to the "interesting" part of a response, for
 *                     pretty-printing.
 *   x-mastro-extract  turn a non-JSON response into structured objects for
 *                     sites with no JSON API — CSS selectors over HTML, or a
 *                     tree walk over a React Server Components (Flight) stream.
 *   x-mastro-body     a raw request-body template for fixed envelopes that
 *                     can't be assembled from `parameters` (server-driven UI).
 *   x-mastro-hidden   omit this operation from the CLI (metadata-only endpoints).
